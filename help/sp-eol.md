# Adobe Search&Promote End-of-Service Announcement

## Frequently asked questions about End-of-Service for Search&Promote

### **_On what date will Search&Promote cease to operate?_**

  End-of-Service for Adobe Search&Promote is scheduled for **September 1, 2022**. On that date, the Search&Promote administrative user interface will no longer be accessible, and requests to Search&Promote APIs will no longer deliver results. Before this date, the service will be fully available and functional. In anticipation of September 1, 2022, contractual entitlements to Search&Promote will not be allowed beyond August 31, 2022.

### **_What will happen if a search or other API request is made to Search&Promote?_**

  Search and other API requests made to Search&Promote will no longer return results. Requests can result in a “Host not Found” error, a 3xx HTTP redirect, or an HTTP error such as 404, 408, or other HTTP error code.

### **_Does Adobe have alternative options for site search and commerce search?_**

  Yes. For product and commerce search, [Live Search from Magento Commerce](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2020/11/23/new-ai-capabilities-for-magento-commerce-improve-retail.html) is Adobe’s search application going forward. Live Search from Magento Commerce is targeted to launch in the first half of 2021.

<!-- ### **_Can Adobe recommend any frameworks or platforms that offer features similar to Search&Promote?_**

  Yes. If the Search&Promote feature is critical to your marketing strategy, consider the many open-source frameworks that exist to power search, including [Apache Solr](https://solr.apache.org/) and [Elastic Free and Open](https://www.elastic.co/about/free-and-open).  

  Also, both [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/) and [Microsoft® Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/search/) provide cloud-native search capabilities on their respective cloud platforms. You can integrate both options into Adobe Experience Manager Sites to power site search and more. -->

### **_Who can I contact to learn more?_**

  Reach out to your Customer Success Manager (CSM) with any questions or contact the Adobe team at [searchquestions@adobe.com](mailto:searchquestions@adobe.com).

### **_Can I still renew my applicable Search&Promote license before its end-of-service?_**

  Yes. Work with your Adobe representative to renew your license with a contract end date no later than **August 31, 2022**.
