# About the Crawling menu{#about-the-crawling-menu}

Use the Crawling menu set date and URL masks, passwords, content types, connections, form definitions, and URL entrypoints.

## About URL Entrypoints {#concept_5D857E3B5C124E85BC0B5AE77A509573}

Most websites have one primary entry point or home page that a customer initially visits. This main entry point is the URL address from which the search robot begins index crawling. However, if your website has multiple domains or subdomains, or if portions of your site are not linked from the primary entry point, you can use URL Entrypoints to add more entry points.

All website pages below each specified URL entry point are indexed. You can combine URL entry points with masks to control exactly which portions of a website that you want to index. You must rebuild your website index before the effects of URL Entrypoints settings are visible to customers.

The main entry point is typically the URL of the website that you want to index and search. You configure this main entry point in Account Settings.

See [Configuring your account settings](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-account-options-menu.md#task_80A38D0C8E4F453395BD67B81E4B45D9).

After you have specified the main URL entry point, you can optionally specify additional entry points that you want to crawl in order. Most often you will specify additional entry points for web pages that are not linked from pages under the main entry point. Specify additional entry points when your website spans more than one domain as in the following example:

`https://www.domain.com/`

`https://www.domain.com/not_linked/but_search_me_too/`

`https://more.domain.com/`

You qualify each entry point with one or more of the following space-separated keywords in the table below. These keywords affect how the page is indexed.

**Important**: Be sure that you separate a given keyword from the entry point and from each other by a space; a comma is not a valid separator.

<table> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> <p>Keyword </p> </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> <p>Description </p> </th>

   <td colname="col1"> <p>noindex </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> If you do not want to index the text on the entry point page, but you do want to follow the page's links, add

     <code>
       content="nofollow"

     </code> is typically used so that the search robot can submit the login form and receive the appropriate cookies before crawling the website. When the "form" keyword is used, the entry point page is not indexed and the search robot does not mark the entry point page as crawled. Use 
     <code>
       nofollow 
     </code> if you do not want the search robot to follow the page's links. </p> </td>

## About URL Masks {#concept_8039DFC53FF3410AA494D602F71BA164}

URL masks are patterns that determine which of your website documents the search robot indexes or not indexes.

Be sure that you rebuild your site index so that the results of your URL masks are visible to your customers.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

The following are two kinds of URL masks that you can use:

* Include URL masks 
* Exclude URL masks

Include URL masks tell the search robot to index any documents that match the mask's pattern.

Exclude URL masks tell the search robot to index matching documents.

As the search robot travels from link to link through your website, it encounters URLs and looks for masks that match those URLs. The first match determines whether to include or exclude that URL from the index. If no mask matches an encountered URL, that URL is discarded from the index.

Include URL masks for your entrypoint URLs are automatically generated. This behavior ensures that all encountered documents on your website are indexed. It also conveniently does away with links that "leave" your website. For example, if an indexed page links to https://www.yahoo.com, the search robot does not index that URL because it does not match the include mask automatically generated by the entrypoint URL.

Each URL mask that you specify must be on a separate line.

The mask can specify any of the following:

* A full path as in `https://www.mydomain.com/products.html`. 
* A partial path as in `https://www.mydomain.com/products`. 
* A URL that uses wild cards as in `https://www.mydomain.com/*.html`. 
* A regular expression (for advanced users).

  To make a mask a regular expression, insert the keyword `regexp` between the mask type ( `exclude` or `include`) and the URL mask.

The following is a simple exclude URL mask example:

```
exclude https://www.mydomain.com/photos
```

Because this example is an exclude URL mask, any document that matches the pattern is not indexed. The pattern matches any encountered item, both files and folders, so that `https://www.mydomain.com/photos.html` and `https://www.mydomain.com/photos/index.html`, both of which match the exclude URL, are not indexed. To match only files in the `/photos/` folder, the URL mask must contain a trailing slash as in the following example:

```
exclude https://www.mydomain.com/photos/
```

The following exclude mask example uses a wild card. It tells the search robot to overlook files with the ".pdf" extension. The search robot does not add these files to your index.

```
exclude *.pdf
```

A simple include URL mask is the following:

```
include https://www.mydomain.com/news/
```

Only documents that are linked by way of a series of links from a URL entrypoint, or that are used as a URL entrypoint themselves, are indexed. Solely listing a document's URL as an include URL mask does not index an unlinked document. To add unlinked documents to your index, you can use the URL Entrypoints feature.

See [About URL Entrypoints](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_5D857E3B5C124E85BC0B5AE77A509573).

Include masks and exclude masks can work together. You can exclude a large portion of your website from indexing by creating an exclude URL mask yet include one or more of those excluded pages with an include URL mask. For example, suppose your entrypoint URL is the following:

```
https://www.mydomain.com/photos/
```

The search robot crawls and indexes all of the pages under `/photos/summer/`, `/photos/spring/` and `/photos/fall/` (assuming that there are links to at least one page in each directory from the `photos` folder). This behavior occurs because the link paths enable the search robot to find the documents in the `/summer/`, `/spring/`, and `/fall/`, folders and the folder URLs match the include mask that is automatically generated by the entrypoint URL.

You can choose to exclude all pages in the `/fall/` folder with an exclude URL mask as in the following example:

```
exclude https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/
```

Or, selectively include only `/photos/fall/redleaves4.html` as part of the index with the following URL mask:

```
include https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/redleaves4.html
```

For the above two mask examples to work as intended, the include mask is listed first, as in the following:

```
include https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/redleaves4.html 
exclude https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/
```

Because the search robot follows directions in the order that they are listed, the search robot first includes `/photos/fall/redleaves4.html`, and then excludes the rest of the files in the `/fall` folder.

If the instructions are specified in the opposite way as in the following:

```
exclude https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/ 
include https://www.mydomain.com/photos/fall/redleaves4.html
```

Then `/photos/fall/redleaves4.html` is not included, even though the mask specifies that it is included.

A URL mask that appears first always takes precedence over a URL mask that appears later in the mask settings. Additionally, if the search robot encounters a page that matches an include URL mask and an exclude URL mask, the mask that is listed first always takes precedence.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

## About using keywords with URL masks {#section_7609A7A6D79B482ABCA8900886541AAB}

You can qualify each include mask with one or more space-separated keywords, which affect how the matched pages are indexed.

A comma is not valid as a separator between the mask and the keyword; you can only use spaces.

<table> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> <p>Keyword </p> </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> <p>Description </p> </th>

  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>noindex </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p> If you do not want to index the text on the pages that match the URL mask, but you want to follow the matched pages links, add 
     <code>
       noindex 
     </code> after the include URL mask. Be sure that you separate the keyword from the mask with a space as in the following example: </p> <p> <code> include&amp;nbsp;*.swf&amp;nbsp;noindex </code> </p> <p>The above example specifies that the search robot follow all links from files with the 
     <code>

     <code>
       noindex 
     </code> keyword is equivalent to a robot meta tag with

     </code> between the 
     <code>
       &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt; 
     </code> tags of matched pages. </p> </td>

For example, suppose you have the following URL mask: </p> <p> <code> exclude&amp;nbsp;regexp&amp;nbsp;^.*/products/.*\.html$ </code> </p> <p>The search robot excludes matching files such as

## Adding URL masks to index or not index parts of your website {#task_E1AFC17C746048B8843013D979E082C1}

You can use [!DNL URL Masks] to define which parts of your website that you want or do not want crawled and indexed.

Use the Test URL Masks field to test whether a document is or is not included after you index.

Be sure that you rebuild your site index so that the results of your URL masks are visible to your customers.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

**To add URL masks to index or not index parts of your website** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawling]** > **[!UICONTROL URL Masks]**.
1. (Optional) On the [!DNL URL Masks] page, in the **[!UICONTROL Test URL Masks]** field, enter a test URL mask from your website, and then click **[!UICONTROL Test]**.
1. In the [!DNL URL Masks] field, type `include` (to add a website that you want crawled and indexed), or type `exclude` (to block a website from getting crawled and indexed), followed by the URL mask address.

   Enter one URL mask address per line. Example:

   ```
   include https://www.mycompany.com/summer 
   include https://www.mycompany.com/spring 
   exclude regexp .*\.xml 
   exclude https://www.mycompany.com/fall

## About Date Masks {#concept_F4F1F58A646F4A86B8650EC46FDCEF66}

You can use Date Masks to include or exclude files from your search results based on the age of the file.

Be sure that you rebuild your site index so that the results of your URL masks are visible to your customers.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

The following are two kinds of date masks that you can use:

* Include date masks ("include-days" and "include-date")

  Include date masks index files that are dated on or before the specified date. 
* Exclude date masks ("exclude-days" and "exclude-date")

  Exclude date masks index files that are dated on or before the specified date.

By default, the file date is determined from meta tag information. If no Meta tag is found, the date of a file is determined from the HTTP header that is received from the server when the search robot downloads a file.

Each date mask that you specify must be on a separate line.

The mask can specify any of the following:

* A full path as in `https://www.mydomain.com/products.html` 
* A partial path as in `https://www.mydomain.com/products` 
* A URL that uses wild cards `https://www.mydomain.com/*.html` 
* A regular expression. To make a mask a regular expression, insert the keyword `regexp` before the URL.

Both include and exclude date masks can specify a date in one of the two following ways. The masks are only be applied if the matched files were created on or before the specified date:

1. A number of days. For example, suppose your date mask is the following:

   ```
   exclude-days 30 https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive/)
   ```

   The number of specified days is counted back. If the file is dated on or before the arrived upon date, the mask is applied. 

1. An actual date using the format YYYY-MM-DD. For example, suppose your date mask is the following:

   ```
   include-date 2011-02-15 https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive/)
   ```

   If the matched document is dated on or before the specified date, the date mask is applied.

The following is a simple exclude date mask example:

```
exclude-days 90 https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive
```

Because this is an exclude date mask, any file that matches the pattern is not indexed and is 90 days old or older. When you exclude a document, no text is indexed and no links are followed from that file. The file is effectively ignored. In this example, both files and folders might match the specified URL pattern. Notice that both `https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive.html` and `https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive/index.html` match the pattern and are not indexed if they are 90 days old or older. To match only files in the `/docs/archive/` folder, the date mask must contain a trailing slash as in the following:

```
exclude-days 90 https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive/
```

Date masks can also be used with wild cards. The following exclude mask tells the search robot to overlook files with the ".pdf" extension that are dated on or before 2011-02-15. The search robot does not add any matched files to your index.

```
exclude-date 2011-02-15 *.pdf
```

Include date mask looks similar, only matched files are added to the index. The following include date mask example tells the search robot to index the text from any files that are zero days old or older in the `/docs/archive/manual/` area of the website.

```
include-days 0 https://www.mydomain.com/docs/archive/manual/
```

Include masks and exclude masks can work together. For example, you can exclude a large portion of your website from indexing by creating an exclude date mask yet include one or more of those excluded pages with an include URL mask. If your entrypoint URL is the following:

```
https://www.mydomain.com/archive/
```

The search robot crawls and indexes all of the pages under `/archive/summer/`, `/archive/spring/`, and `/archive/fall/` (assuming that there are links to at least one page in each folder from the `archive` folder). This behavior occurs because the link paths enable the search robot to "find" the files in the `/summer/`, `/spring/`, and `/fall/` folders and the folder URLs match the include mask automatically generated by the entrypoint URL.

See [About URL Entrypoints](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_5D857E3B5C124E85BC0B5AE77A509573).

See [Configuring your account settings](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-account-options-menu.md#task_80A38D0C8E4F453395BD67B81E4B45D9).

You may choose to exclude all pages over 90 days old in the `/fall/` folder with an exclude date mask as in the following:

```
exclude-days 90 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/
```

You can selectively include only `/archive/fall/index.html` (regardless of how old it is--any file 0 days or older are matched) as part of the index with the following date mask:

```
include-days 0 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/index.html
```

For the above two mask examples to work as intended, you must list the include mask first as in the following:

```
include-days 0 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/index.html 
exclude-days 90 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/
```

Because the search robot follows directions in the order they are specified, the search robot first includes `/archive/fall/index.html`, and then excludes the rest of the files in the `/fall` folder.

If the instructions are specified in the opposite way as in the following:

```
exclude-days 90 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/ 
include-days 0 https://www.mydomain.com/archive/fall/index.html 
```

Then `/archive/fall/index.html` is not included, even though the mask specifies that it should be. A date mask that appears first always takes precedence over a date mask that might appear later in the mask settings. Additionally, if the search robot encounters a page that matches both an include date mask and an exclude date mask, the mask that is listed first always takes precedence.

## Adding date masks to index or not index parts of your website {#task_0010543C55F648D2B5DEFEFAD60FAF04}

You can use Date Masks to include or exclude files from customer search results based on the age of the files.

Use the **[!UICONTROL Test Date]** and **[!UICONTROL Test URL]** fields to test whether a file is or is not included after you index.

Be sure that you rebuild your site index so that the results of your URL masks are visible to your customers.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

**To add date masks to index or not index parts of your website** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawling]** > **[!UICONTROL Date Masks]**.
1. (Optional) On the [!DNL Date Masks] page, in the **[!UICONTROL Test Date]** field, enter a date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD (for example, `2011-07-25`); in the **[!UICONTROL Test URL]** field, enter a URL mask from your website, and then click **[!UICONTROL Test]**.
1. In the [!DNL Date Masks] field, enter one date mask address per line.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.
1. (Optional) Do any of the following:

    * Click **[!UICONTROL History]** to revert any changes that you have made.

      See [Using the History option](../t-using-the-history-option.md#task_70DD3F87A67242BBBD2CB27156F43002). 
    
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Live]**.

      See [Viewing live settings](../c-about-staging.md#task_401A0EBDB5DB4D4CA933CBA7BECDC10F). 
    
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Push Live]**.

      See [Pushing stage settings live](../c-about-staging.md#task_44306783B4C0408AAA58B471DAF2D9A4).

## About Passwords {#concept_3EDBD731725D46B891F834D4472774DC}

To access portions of your website that are protected with HTTP Basic Authentication, you can add one or more passwords.

Before the effects of the Password settings is visible to customers, you must rebuild your site index.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

On the [!DNL Passwords] page, you type each password on a single line. The password consists of a URL or realm, a user name, and a password, as in the following example:

```
https://www.mydomain.com/ myname mypassword
```

Instead of the using a URL path, like above, you could also specify a realm.

To determine the correct realm to use, open a password-protected web page with a browser and look at the "Enter Network Password" dialog box.

![](assets/realms.gif)

The realm name, in this case, is "My Site Realm."

Using the realm name above, your password might look like the following:

```
My Site Realm myusername mypassword
```

If your web site has multiple realms, you can create multiple passwords by entering a user name and password for each realm on a separate line as in the following example:

```
Realm1 name1 password1 
Realm2 name2 password2 
Realm3 name3 password3
```

You can intermix passwords that contain URLs or realms so that your password list might look like the following:

```
Realm1 name1 password1 
https://www.mysite.com/path1/path2 name2 password2 
Realm3 name3 password3 
Realm4 name4 password4 
https://www.mysite.com/path1/path5 name5 password5 
https://www.mysite.com/path6 name6 password6
```

In the list above, the first password is used that contains a realm or URL that matches the server's authentication request. Even if the file at `https://www.mysite.com/path1/path2/index.html` is in `Realm3`, for example, `name2` and `password2` are used because the password that is defined with the URL is listed above the one defined with the realm. 

## Adding passwords for accessing areas of your website that require authentication {#task_DED19D476FF04B48BB6456D5ECB8628A}

You can use Passwords to access password-protected areas of your website for crawling and indexing purposes.

Before the effects of your password are additions are visible to customers, be sure you rebuild your site index

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

**To add passwords for accessing areas of your website that require authentication** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawling]** > **[!UICONTROL Passwords]**.
1. On the [!DNL Passwords] page, in the **[!UICONTROL Passwords]** field, enter a realm or URL, and its associated user name, and password, separated by a space.

   Example of a realm password and a URL password on separate lines:

   ```
   Realm1 name1 password1 
   https://www.mysite.com/path1/path2 name2 password2
   ```

   Only add one password per line. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Changes]**.

## About Content Types {#concept_6FEA1355C0374500B4C53090C34A8A07}

You can use [!DNL Content Types] to select which types of files that you want to crawl and index for this account.

Content types that you can choose to crawl and index include PDF documents, text documents, Adobe Flash movies, files from Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, and text in MP3 files. The text that is found within the selected content types is searched along with all of the other text on your website.

Before the effects of the Content Types settings is visible to customers, you must rebuild your site index.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

## About indexing MP3 music files {#section_AD2E28BEEE3E46629E2B05C34A963673}

If you select the option **[!UICONTROL Text in MP3 Music Files]** on the [!DNL Content Types] page, an MP3 file is crawled and indexed in one of two ways. The first and most common way is from an anchor href tag in an HTML file as in the following:

```
<a href="MP3-file-URL"></a>
```

The second way is to enter the URL of the MP3 file as a URL entrypoint.

See [About URL Entrypoints](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_5D857E3B5C124E85BC0B5AE77A509573).

An MP3 file is recognized by its MIME type "audio/mpeg".

Be aware that MP3 music file sizes can be quite large, even though they usually contain only a small amount of text. For example, MP3 files can optionally store such things as the album name, artist name, song title, song genre, year of release, and a comment. This information is stored at the very end of the file in what is called the TAG. MP3 files containing TAG information are indexed in the following way:

* The song title is treated like the title of an HTML page. 
* The comment is treated like a description that is defined for an HTML page. 
* The genre is treated like a keyword that is defined for an HTML page. 
* The artist name, album name, and year of release are treated like the body of an HTML page.

Note that each MP3 file that is crawled and indexed on your website counts as one page.

If your website contains many large MP3 files, you may exceed the indexing byte limit for your account. If this happens, you can deselect **[!UICONTROL Text in MP3 Music Files]** on the [!DNL Content Types] page to prevent the indexing of all MP3 files on your website.

If you only want to prevent the indexing of certain MP3 files on your website, you can do one of the following:

* Surround the anchor tags that link to the MP3 files with `<nofollow>` and `</nofollow>` tags. The search robot does not follow links between those tags.

* Add the URLs of the MP3 files as exclude masks.

  See [About URL Masks](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_8039DFC53FF3410AA494D602F71BA164).

## Selecting content types to crawl and index {#task_CCAC5C67C8BF4AB7B79D34A1495D5EE8}

You can use [!DNL Content Types] to select which types of files that you want to crawl and index for this account.

Content types that you can choose to crawl and index include PDF documents, text documents, Adobe Flash movies, files from Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, and text in MP3 files. The text that is found within the selected content types is searched along with all of the other text on your website.

## About Connections {#concept_E2F3B7E7521147479E5948A94BB3A40B}

You can use Connections to add up to ten HTTP connections that the search robot uses to index your website.

Increasing the number of connections can significantly reduce the amount of time that it takes to complete a crawl and index. However, be aware that each additional connection increases the load on your server. 

## Adding connections to increase indexing speed {#task_3E9B83E43C1842A19066355A15C4A6FB}

You can reduce the amount of time it takes to index your website by using Connections to increase the number of simultaneous HTTP connections that the crawler uses. You can add up to ten connections.

Be aware that each additional connection increases the load that is placed on your server.

**To add connections to increase indexing speed** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawling]** > **[!UICONTROL Connections]**.
1. On the [!DNL Parallel Indexing Connections] page, in the **[!UICONTROL Number of Connections]** field, enter the number of connections (1-10) that you want to add.

## About Form Submission {#concept_CADD5D7CF373497DAA6F8564D7BC8502}

You can use Form Submission to help you recognize and process forms on your website.

During the crawling and indexing of your website, each encountered form is compared with the form definitions that you have added. If a form matches a form definition, the form is submitted for indexing. If a form matches more than one definition, the form is submitted once for each matched definition. 

## Adding form definitions for indexing forms on your website {#task_62FBCE9E6DBE4BDA8D1249233ADFC00F}

You can use [!DNL Form Submission] to help process forms that are recognized on your website for indexing purposes.

Be sure that you rebuild your site index so that the results of your changes are visible to your customers.

See [Configuring an incremental index of a staged website](../c-about-index-menu/c-about-incremental-index.md#task_46A367B0786C4C90BFFA5D3F95FD86C0).

**To add form definitions for indexing forms on your website** 

1. On the product menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawling]** > **[!UICONTROL Form Submission]**.
1. On the [!DNL Form Submission] page, click **[!UICONTROL Add New Form]**.
1. On the [!DNL Add Form Definition] page, set the [!DNL Form Recognition] and [!DNL Form Submission] options.

   The five options in the [!DNL Form Recognition] section on the [!DNL Form Definition] page are used to identify forms in your web pages that can be process.

   The three options in the [!DNL Form Submission] section are used to specify the parameters and values that are submitted with a form to your web server.

   Enter one recognition or submission parameter per line. Each parameter must include a name and a value.

## About Index Connector {#concept_CA6921E2FBF641F9B4F60C92B32AFA84}

Use [!DNL Index Connector] to define additional input sources for indexing XML pages or any kind of feed.

You can use a data feed input source to access content that is stored in a form that is different from what is typically discovered on a website using one of the available crawl methods. Each document that is crawled and indexed directly corresponds to a content page on your website. However, a data feed either comes from an XML document or from a comma- or tab-delimited text file, and contains the content information to index.

An XML data source consists of XML stanzas, or records, that contain information that corresponds to individual documents. These individual documents are added to the index. A text data feed contains individual new-line-delimited records that correspond to individual documents. These individual documents are also added to the index. In either case, an index connector configuration describes how to interpret the feed. Each configuration describes where the file resides and how the servers access it. The configuration also describes "mapping" information. That is, how each record's items are used to populate the metadata fields in the resulting index.

After you add an Index Connector definition to the [!DNL Staged Index Connector Definitions] page, you can change any configuration setting, *except* for the Name or Type values.

The [!DNL Index Connector] page shows you the following information:

* The name of defined index connectors that you have configured and added. 
* One of the following data source types for each connector that you have added:

    * **Text** - Simple "flat" files, comma-delimited, tab-delimited, or other consistently delimited formats. 
    * **Feed** - XML feeds. 
    * **XML** - Collections of XML documents.

* Whether the connector is enabled or not for the next crawl and indexing done. 
* The address of the data source.

## How the indexing process works for XML configurations in Index Connector {#section_7F1551EA51854C5C99F284CE260526EB}

The indexing process for XML configuration is similar to the process for Text and Feed configurations with the following minor changes and exceptions.

Because the documents for XML crawls are already separated into individual files, steps 1 and 2 in the table above do not directly apply. If you specify a URL in the **[!UICONTROL Host Address]** and **[!UICONTROL File Path]** fields of the [!DNL Index Connector Add] page, it is downloaded and processed as a normal HTML document. The expectation is that the download document contains a collection of `<a href="{url}"...` links, each of which points to an XML document that is processed. Such links are converted to the following form:

```
<a href="index:<ic_config_name>?url="{url}">
```

For example, if the Adobe setup returned the following links:

```
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/somepath/doc1.xml">doc 1</a> 
<a href="https://www.adobe.com/otherpath/doc2.xml">doc 2</a>
```

In the table above, step 3 does not apply and step 4 is completed at the time of crawling and indexing.

Alternately, you can intermix your XML documents with other documents that were discovered naturally through the crawl process. In such cases, you can use rewrite rules ( **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Rewrite Rules]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawl List Retrieve URL Rules]**) to change the XML documents’ URLs to direct them to Index Connector.

See [About Crawl List Retrieve URL Rules](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-rewrite-rules-menu.md#concept_EC8E2E48B99A458D8567B526C9827CBA).

For example, supposed you have the following rewrite rule:

```
RewriteRule (^http.*[.]xml$) index:Adobe?key=$1
```

This rule translates any URL ending with `.xml` into an Index Connector link. The crawler recognizes and rewrites the `index:` URL scheme. The download process is redirected through the Index Connector Apache server on the primary. Each downloaded document is examined using the same regular expression pattern that is used with Feeds. In this case, however, the manufactured HTML document is not saved in the cache. Instead, it is handed directly to the crawler for index processing.

## How to configure multiple Index Connectors {#section_C2B14C0F06354A57AEF6238FF3814E5D}

You can define multiple Index Connector configurations for any account. The configurations are automatically added to the drop-down list in **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Crawl]** > **[!UICONTROL URL Entrypoints]** as shown in the following illustration:

![](assets/url_entrypoints_index_connector.png)

Selecting a configuration from the drop-down list adds the value to the end of the list of URL entry points.

>[!NOTE]
>
>While disabled Index Connector configurations are added to the drop-down list, you cannot select them. If you select the same Index Connector configuration a second time, it is added to the end of the list, and the previous instance is deleted.

To specify an Index Connector entry point for an incremental crawl, you can add entries using the following format:

```
index:<indexconnector_configuration_name>
```

The crawler processes each added entry if it is found on the Index Connectors page and is enabled.

Note: Because each document's URL is constructed using the Index Connector configuration name and the document's primary key, be sure you use the same Index Connector configuration name when performing Incremental updates! Doing so permits [!DNL Adobe Search&amp;Promote] to correctly update previously indexed documents.

See also [About URL Entrypoints](../c-about-settings-menu/c-about-crawling-menu.md#concept_5D857E3B5C124E85BC0B5AE77A509573).

**The use of Setup Maps when you add an Index Connector**

At the time you add an Index Connector, you can optionally use the feature **[!UICONTROL Setup Maps]** to download a sample of your data source. The data is examined for indexing suitability.

<table> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> <p>If you chose the Index Connector type... </p> </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> <p>The Setup Maps feature... </p> </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Text </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Determines the delimiter value by trying tabs first, then vertical-bars ( <span class="codeph"> | </span>), and finally commas ( <span class="codeph"> , </span>). If you already specified a delimiter value before you clicked <span class="uicontrol"> Setup Maps </span>, that value is used instead. </p> <p>The best-fit scheme results in the Map fields being filled out with guesses at the appropriate Tag and Field values. Additionally, a sampling of the parsed data is displayed. Be sure to select <span class="uicontrol"> Headers in First Row </span> if you know that the file includes a header row. The setup function uses this information to better identify the resulting map entries. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Feed </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Downloads the data source and performs simple XML parsing. </p> <p>The resulting XPath identifiers are displayed in the Tag rows of the Map table, and similar values in Fields. These rows only identify the available data, and do not generate the more complicated XPath definitions. However, it is still helpful because it describes the XML data and identifies Itemtag values. </p> <p> <p>Note:  The Setup Maps function downloads the entire XML source to perform its analysis. If the file is large, this operation could time out. </p> </p> <p>When successful, this function identifies all possible XPath items, many of which are not desirable to use. Be sure that you examine the resulting Map definitions and remove the ones that you do not need or want. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>XML </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Downloads the URL of a representative individual document, not the primary link list. This single document is parsed using the same mechanism that is used with Feeds, and the results are displayed. </p> <p>Before you click <span class="uicontrol"> Add </span> to save the configuration, be sure that you change the URL back to the primary link list document. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

**Important**: The Setup Maps feature may not work for large XML data sets because its file parser attempts to read the entire file into memory. As a result, you could experience an out-of-memory condition. However, when the same document is processed at the time of indexing, it is not read into memory. Instead, large documents are processed “on the go,” and are not read entirely into memory first.

**The use of Preview when you add an Index Connector**

At the time you add an Index Connector, you can optionally use the feature **[!UICONTROL Preview]** to validate the data, as though you were saving it. It runs a test against the configuration, but without saving the configuration to the account. The test accesses the configured data source. However, it writes the download cache to a temporary location; it does not conflict with the main cache folder that the indexing crawler uses.

Preview only processes a default of five documents as controlled by Acct:IndexConnector-Preview-Max-Documents. The previewed documents are displayed in source form, as they are presented to the indexing crawler. The display is similar to a “View Source" feature in a Web browser. You can navigate the documents in the preview set using standard navigation links.

Preview does not support XML configurations because such documents are processed directly and not downloaded to the cache. 

## Adding an Index Connector definition {#task_96779B651A654E1F871F55D6DBBC8886}

Each Index Connector configuration defines a data source and mappings to relate the data items defined for that source to metadata fields in the index.

Before the effects of the new and enabled definition is visible to customers, rebuild your site index.
